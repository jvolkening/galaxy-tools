<![CDATA[
GOTTCHA is an application of a novel, gene-independent and signature-based
metagenomic taxonomic profiling method with significantly smaller false
discovery rates (FDR) that is laptop deployable. Our algorithm was tested and
validated on twenty synthetic and mock datasets ranging in community
composition and complexity, was applied successfully to data generated from
spiked environmental and clinical samples, and robustly demonstrates superior
performance compared with other available tools.
