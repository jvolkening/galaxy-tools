    GOTTCHA is an application of a novel, gene-independent and signature-based
    metagenomic taxonomic profiling method with significantly smaller false
    discovery rates (FDR) that is laptop deployable. Our algorithm was tested and
    validated on twenty synthetic and mock datasets ranging in community
    composition and complexity, was applied successfully to data generated from
    spiked environmental and clinical samples, and robustly demonstrates superior
    performance compared with other available tools.  homepage_url:
