PURPOSE
    Estimate gene and isoform expression from RNA-Seq data.

SYNOPSIS
     rsem-calculate-expression [options] upstream_read_file(s) reference_name sample_name 
     rsem-calculate-expression [options] --paired-end upstream_read_file(s) downstream_read_file(s) reference_name sample_name 
     rsem-calculate-expression [options] --alignments [--paired-end] input reference_name sample_name

ARGUMENTS
    upstream_read_files(s)
        Comma-separated list of files containing single-end reads or upstream
        reads for paired-end data. By default, these files are assumed to be
        in FASTQ format. If the --no-qualities option is specified, then FASTA
        format is expected.

    downstream_read_file(s)
        Comma-separated list of files containing downstream reads which are
        paired with the upstream reads. By default, these files are assumed to
        be in FASTQ format. If the --no-qualities option is specified, then
        FASTA format is expected.

    input
        SAM/BAM/CRAM formatted input file. If "-" is specified for the
        filename, the input is instead assumed to come from standard input.
        RSEM requires all alignments of the same read group together. For
        paired-end reads, RSEM also requires the two mates of any alignment be
        adjacent. In addition, RSEM does not allow the SEQ and QUAL fields to
        be empty. See Description section for how to make input file obey
        RSEM's requirements.

    reference_name
        The name of the reference used. The user must have run
        'rsem-prepare-reference' with this reference_name before running this
        program.

    sample_name
        The name of the sample analyzed. All output files are prefixed by this
        name (e.g., sample_name.genes.results)


BASIC OPTIONS
    --paired-end
        Input reads are paired-end reads. (Default: off)

    --no-qualities
        Input reads do not contain quality scores. (Default: off)

    --strandedness <none|forward|reverse>
        This option defines the strandedness of the RNA-Seq reads. It
        recognizes three values: 'none', 'forward', and 'reverse'. 'none'
        refers to non-strand-specific protocols. 'forward' means all
        (upstream) reads are derived from the forward strand. 'reverse' means
        all (upstream) reads are derived from the reverse strand. If
        'forward'/'reverse' is set, the '--norc'/'--nofw' Bowtie/Bowtie 2
        option will also be enabled to avoid aligning reads to the opposite
        strand. For Illumina TruSeq Stranded protocols, please use 'reverse'.
        (Default: 'none')

    -p/--num-threads <int>
        Number of threads to use. Both Bowtie/Bowtie2, expression estimation
        and 'samtools sort' will use this many threads. (Default: 1)

    --alignments
        Input file contains alignments in SAM/BAM/CRAM format. The exact file
        format will be determined automatically. (Default: off)

    --fai <file>
        If the header section of input alignment file does not contain
        reference sequence information, this option should be turned on.
        <file> is a FAI format file containing each reference sequence's name
        and length. Please refer to the SAM official website for the details
        of FAI format. (Default: off)

    --bowtie2
        Use Bowtie 2 instead of Bowtie to align reads. Since currently RSEM
        does not handle indel, local and discordant alignments, the Bowtie2
        parameters are set in a way to avoid those alignments. In particular,
        we use options '--sensitive --dpad 0 --gbar 99999999 --mp 1,1 --np 1
        --score-min L,0,-0.1' by default. The last parameter of '--score-min',
        '-0.1', is the negative of maximum mismatch rate. This rate can be set
        by option '--bowtie2-mismatch-rate'. If reads are paired-end, we
        additionally use options '--no-mixed' and '--no-discordant'. (Default:
        off)

    --star
        Use STAR to align reads. Alignment parameters are from ENCODE3's
        STAR-RSEM pipeline. To save computational time and memory resources,
        STAR's Output BAM file is unsorted. It is stored in RSEM's temporary
        directory with name as 'sample_name.bam'. Each STAR job will have its
        own private copy of the genome in memory. (Default: off)

    --append-names
        If gene_name/transcript_name is available, append it to the end of
        gene_id/transcript_id (separated by '_') in files
        'sample_name.isoforms.results' and 'sample_name.genes.results'.
        (Default: off)

    --seed <uint32>
        Set the seed for the random number generators used in calculating
        posterior mean estimates and credibility intervals. The seed must be a
        non-negative 32 bit integer. (Default: off)

    --single-cell-prior
        By default, RSEM uses Dirichlet(1) as the prior to calculate posterior
        mean estimates and credibility intervals. However, much less genes are
        expressed in single cell RNA-Seq data. Thus, if you want to compute
        posterior mean estimates and/or credibility intervals and you have
        single-cell RNA-Seq data, you are recommended to turn on this option.
        Then RSEM will use Dirichlet(0.1) as the prior which encourage the
        sparsity of the expression levels. (Default: off)

    --calc-pme
        Run RSEM's collapsed Gibbs sampler to calculate posterior mean
        estimates. (Default: off)

    --calc-ci
        Calculate 95% credibility intervals and posterior mean estimates. The
        credibility level can be changed by setting '--ci-credibility-level'.
        (Default: off)

    -q/--quiet
        Suppress the output of logging information. (Default: off)

    -h/--help
        Show help information.

    --version
        Show version information.

OUTPUT OPTIONS
    --sort-bam-by-read-name
        Sort BAM file aligned under transcript coordidate by read name.
        Setting this option on will produce deterministic maximum likelihood
        estimations from independent runs. Note that sorting will take long
        time and lots of memory. (Default: off)

    --no-bam-output
        Do not output any BAM file. (Default: off)

    --sampling-for-bam
        When RSEM generates a BAM file, instead of outputting all alignments a
        read has with their posterior probabilities, one alignment is sampled
        according to the posterior probabilities. The sampling procedure
        includes the alignment to the "noise" transcript, which does not
        appear in the BAM file. Only the sampled alignment has a weight of 1.
        All other alignments have weight 0. If the "noise" transcript is
        sampled, all alignments appeared in the BAM file should have weight 0.
        (Default: off)

    --output-genome-bam
        Generate a BAM file, 'sample_name.genome.bam', with alignments mapped
        to genomic coordinates and annotated with their posterior
        probabilities. In addition, RSEM will call samtools (included in RSEM
        package) to sort and index the bam file.
        'sample_name.genome.sorted.bam' and
        'sample_name.genome.sorted.bam.bai' will be generated. (Default: off)

    --sort-bam-by-coordinate
        Sort RSEM generated transcript and genome BAM files by coordinates and
        build associated indices. (Default: off)

    --sort-bam-memory-per-thread <string>
        Set the maximum memory per thread that can be used by 'samtools sort'.
        <string> represents the memory and accepts suffices 'K/M/G'. RSEM will
        pass <string> to the '-m' option of 'samtools sort'. Note that the
        default used here is different from the default used by samtools.
        (Default: 1G)

ALIGNER OPTIONS
    --seed-length <int>
        Seed length used by the read aligner. Providing the correct value is
        important for RSEM. If RSEM runs Bowtie, it uses this value for
        Bowtie's seed length parameter. Any read with its or at least one of
        its mates' (for paired-end reads) length less than this value will be
        ignored. If the references are not added poly(A) tails, the minimum
        allowed value is 5, otherwise, the minimum allowed value is 25. Note
        that this script will only check if the value >= 5 and give a warning
        message if the value < 25 but >= 5. (Default: 25)

    --phred33-quals
        Input quality scores are encoded as Phred+33. (Default: on)

    --phred64-quals
        Input quality scores are encoded as Phred+64 (default for GA Pipeline
        ver. >= 1.3). (Default: off)

    --solexa-quals
        Input quality scores are solexa encoded (from GA Pipeline ver. < 1.3).
        (Default: off)

    --bowtie-path <path>
        The path to the Bowtie executables. (Default: the path to the Bowtie
        executables is assumed to be in the user's PATH environment variable)

    --bowtie-n <int>
        (Bowtie parameter) max # of mismatches in the seed. (Range: 0-3,
        Default: 2)

    --bowtie-e <int>
        (Bowtie parameter) max sum of mismatch quality scores across the
        alignment. (Default: 99999999)

    --bowtie-m <int>
        (Bowtie parameter) suppress all alignments for a read if > <int> valid
        alignments exist. (Default: 200)

    --bowtie-chunkmbs <int>
        (Bowtie parameter) memory allocated for best first alignment
        calculation (Default: 0 - use Bowtie's default)

    --bowtie2-path <path>
        (Bowtie 2 parameter) The path to the Bowtie 2 executables. (Default:
        the path to the Bowtie 2 executables is assumed to be in the user's
        PATH environment variable)

    --bowtie2-mismatch-rate <double>
        (Bowtie 2 parameter) The maximum mismatch rate allowed. (Default: 0.1)

    --bowtie2-k <int>
        (Bowtie 2 parameter) Find up to <int> alignments per read. (Default:
        200)

    --bowtie2-sensitivity-level <string>
        (Bowtie 2 parameter) Set Bowtie 2's preset options in --end-to-end
        mode. This option controls how hard Bowtie 2 tries to find alignments.
        <string> must be one of "very_fast", "fast", "sensitive" and
        "very_sensitive". The four candidates correspond to Bowtie 2's
        "--very-fast", "--fast", "--sensitive" and "--very-sensitive" options.
        (Default: "sensitive" - use Bowtie 2's default)

    --star-path <path>
        The path to STAR's executable. (Default: the path to STAR executable
        is assumed to be in user's PATH environment variable)

    --star-gzipped-read-file
        (STAR parameter) Input read file(s) is compressed by gzip. (Default:
        off)

    --star-bzipped-read-file
        (STAR parameter) Input read file(s) is compressed by bzip2. (Default:
        off)

    --star-output-genome-bam
        (STAR parameter) Save the BAM file from STAR alignment under genomic
        coordinate to 'sample_name.STAR.genome.bam'. This file is NOT sorted
        by genomic coordinate. In this file, according to STAR's manual,
        'paired ends of an alignment are always adjacent, and multiple
        alignments of a read are adjacent as well'. (Default: off)


ADVANCED OPTIONS
    --tag <string>
        The name of the optional field used in the SAM input for identifying a
        read with too many valid alignments. The field should have the format
        <tagName>:i:<value>, where a <value> bigger than 0 indicates a read
        with too many alignments. (Default: "")

    --fragment-length-min <int>
        Minimum read/insert length allowed. This is also the value for the
        Bowtie/Bowtie2 -I option. (Default: 1)

    --fragment-length-max <int>
        Maximum read/insert length allowed. This is also the value for the
        Bowtie/Bowtie 2 -X option. (Default: 1000)

    --fragment-length-mean <double>
        (single-end data only) The mean of the fragment length distribution,
        which is assumed to be a Gaussian. (Default: -1, which disables use of
        the fragment length distribution)

    --fragment-length-sd <double>
        (single-end data only) The standard deviation of the fragment length
        distribution, which is assumed to be a Gaussian. (Default: 0, which
        assumes that all fragments are of the same length, given by the
        rounded value of --fragment-length-mean)

    --estimate-rspd
        Set this option if you want to estimate the read start position
        distribution (RSPD) from data. Otherwise, RSEM will use a uniform
        RSPD. (Default: off)

    --num-rspd-bins <int>
        Number of bins in the RSPD. Only relevant when '--estimate-rspd' is
        specified. Use of the default setting is recommended. (Default: 20)

    --gibbs-burnin <int>
        The number of burn-in rounds for RSEM's Gibbs sampler. Each round
        passes over the entire data set once. If RSEM can use multiple
        threads, multiple Gibbs samplers will start at the same time and all
        samplers share the same burn-in number. (Default: 200)

    --gibbs-number-of-samples <int>
        The total number of count vectors RSEM will collect from its Gibbs
        samplers. (Default: 1000)

    --gibbs-sampling-gap <int>
        The number of rounds between two succinct count vectors RSEM collects.
        If the count vector after round N is collected, the count vector after
        round N + <int> will also be collected. (Default: 1)

    --ci-credibility-level <double>
        The credibility level for credibility intervals. (Default: 0.95)

    --ci-memory <int>
        Maximum size (in memory, MB) of the auxiliary buffer used for
        computing credibility intervals (CI). (Default: 1024)

    --ci-number-of-samples-per-count-vector <int>
        The number of read generating probability vectors sampled per sampled
        count vector. The crebility intervals are calculated by first sampling
        P(C | D) and then sampling P(Theta | C) for each sampled count vector.
        This option controls how many Theta vectors are sampled per sampled
        count vector. (Default: 50)

    --keep-intermediate-files
        Keep temporary files generated by RSEM. RSEM creates a temporary
        directory, 'sample_name.temp', into which it puts all intermediate
        output files. If this directory already exists, RSEM overwrites all
        files generated by previous RSEM runs inside of it. By default, after
        RSEM finishes, the temporary directory is deleted. Set this option to
        prevent the deletion of this directory and the intermediate files
        inside of it. (Default: off)

    --temporary-folder <string>
        Set where to put the temporary files generated by RSEM. If the folder
        specified does not exist, RSEM will try to create it. (Default:
        sample_name.temp)

    --time
        Output time consumed by each step of RSEM to 'sample_name.time'.
        (Default: off)
