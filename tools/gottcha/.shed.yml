long_description: |
    GOTTCHA (Genomic Origin Through Taxonomic CHAllenge) is an application of
    a novel, gene-independent and signature-based metagenomic taxonomic
    profiling method with significantly smaller false discovery rates (FDR)
    that is also laptop deployable. Our algorithm was tested and validated on
    twenty synthetic and mock datasets ranging in community composition and
    complexity, was applied successfully to data generated from spiked
    environmental and clinical samples, and robustly demonstrates superior
    performance compared with other available tools.
