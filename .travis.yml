# This is a special configuration file to run tests on Travis-CI via
# GitHub notifications when changes are committed.
#
# See http://travis-ci.org/ for details

# This file is heavily inspired by Peter Cock's efforts. See more details at
# http://blastedbio.blogspot.com/2013/09/using-travis-ci-for-testing-galaxy-tools.html

# We need Python 2.6 or 2.7 to run Galaxy but many Galaxy tools also need Java
# to run the simplest way to get that installed is to just start with "java".
# (which will still have a system python installed).
language: java

script:
 - wget -O- https://raw.github.com/galaxyproject/planemo/master/scripts/travis_test.sh | /bin/bash -x
